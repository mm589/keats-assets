</p><ul>
<li>robust and transparent mechanisms for securing an appropriate level of resource for delivering an accreditable MPharm degree;</li>
<li>sufficient staff from relevant disciplines to deliver the curriculum to students <i>and trainees.</i> Staff must be appropriately qualified and experienced. The staffing profile must include:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>sufficient numbers of pharmacists – registrants of the GPhC – with experience of teaching in higher education to ensure that an MPharm degree can produce students equipped to enter pharmacist pre-registration training in Great Britain;</li>
<li>sufficient numbers of pharmacists to act as tutors and professional mentors at university <i>and in pre-registration.</i> Not all personal tutors must be pharmacists;</li>
<li>pharmacists who are leaders in the profession, the school and their university, who can influence school and university policy relevant to pharmacy;</li>
<li>non-pharmacist academics who can influence school and university policy relevant to pharmacy;</li>
<li>staff who are sufficiently experienced to supervise research. It would be unusual for anyone to supervise research at a particular academic level unless they had previously researched to that level or beyond. New research supervisors must be mentored and signed off as being fit to supervise after a period of mentoring;</li>
<li>science academics who understand the relevance of their discipline to pharmacy and deliver their area of expertise in a pharmaceutical context;</li>
<li>academic pharmacists and other experienced MPharm degree staff who act as mentors to non-pharmacist colleagues;</li>

<li><i>pre-registration tutors who meet the GPHC’s standards for preregistration tutors;</i></li>
<li>career pathways in universities for all staff teaching on MPharm degrees, including pathways for practice staff;</li>
<li>clear lines of authority and responsibility for the strategic organisation and day-to-day management of placements;</li>
<li>training and ongoing support for all non-pharmacists involved in the delivery of MPharm degrees which must help them understand:</li>

  <div class="gphcpanel">
  <p></p>
9.3 &nbsp; Initial education and training providers exercise an appropriate level of autonomy over pharmacy resources to deliver an MPharm degree to the required standard and in an appropriate learning environment. The precise nature of the autonomy of pharmacy and its senior managers will be determined by the institutional context in which pharmacy finds itself. However, whatever the context, there must be robust and transparent ways of securing resources for pharmacy.
<p></p>
9.4 &nbsp; Initial education and training environments must support students <i>and trainees</i> to achieve the outcomes in Standard 10.
<p></p>
9.5 &nbsp; These standards describe the types of staff required to deliver an MPharm degree <i>and pre-registration training. All pre-registration tutors must be pharmacists</i> and some MPharm degree staff must be pharmacists. It is important to remember what the legal definition of a pharmacist is:
<p></p>
<blockquote>‘A person practises as a pharmacist or a pharmacy technician if, whilst acting in the capacity of or purporting to be a pharmacist or a pharmacy technician, that person undertakes any work or gives any advice in relation to the preparation, assembly, dispensing, sale, supply or use of medicines, the science of medicines, the practice of pharmacy or the provision of healthcare.’ (The Pharmacy Order 2010)</blockquote>
<p></p>
In a university context, this definition is not restricted to staff who teach pharmacy practice but includes staff involved in ‘the provision of healthcare’ and ‘the science of medicines’ among other things. This definition means that staff other than teacher-practitioners or pharmacy practice staff may be registered as pharmacists.
<p></p>
Note: The GPhC does not have a non-practising registration category. Membership of other organisations is not equivalent to registration as a pharmacist.
