<h4><p style="color:#00B9E1">5. &nbsp; The curriculum for MPharm degrees and the pre-registration scheme must deliver the outcomes in Standard 10. Most importantly, curricula must ensure that students <i>and trainees</i> practise safely and effectively. To ensure this, pass criteria must describe safe and effective practice.</p></h4>
<button class="accordion" role="button">Criteria to meet this standard</button>
<div class="gphcpanel">
  <p>5.1 &nbsp; Curricula must be integrated. This does not mean necessarily that initial education and training must be delivered as a five-year MPharm degree with integrated pre-registration training, but that the component parts of education and training must be linked in a coherent way.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp; Curricula must be progressive, dealing with issues in an increasingly more complex way until the right level of understanding is reached:</p><p>
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/mm589/keats-sbe-mpharm-1819/35170dd9/homepage/gphcstandards/GPhC_Standard_5_Spiral_Curriculum.PNG" alt="GPhC Standard 5 Spiral Curriculum" width="600" height="520" class="img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom">
<br></p><p></p>
5.3 &nbsp; An MPharm degree must be delivered in an environment which places study in a professional and academic context and requires students to conduct themselves professionally. <i>Pre-registration training must be delivered in a professional environment which requires trainees to conduct themselves professionally.</i>
<p></p>
5.4 &nbsp; An MPharm must be delivered in an environment informed by research. This means that whether or not all staff are engaged in research, their teaching must be informed by current research.
<p></p>
5.5 &nbsp; An MPharm degree teaching and learning strategy must set out how students will achieve the outcomes in Standard 10. Learning opportunities must be structured to provide:
<ul>
<li>an integrated experience of relevant science and pharmacy practice;</li>
<li>a balance of theory and practice;</li>
<li>independent learning skills.</li>
</ul>
5.6 &nbsp; The MPharm degree curriculum must include practical experience of working with patients, carers and other healthcare professionals. Practical experience should increase year on year. We are not suggesting that off-site placement visits are the only way to achieve this. Schools should articulate their strategy for meeting this criterion, which may include off-site placement visits, using patients, carers and other healthcare professionals in-class, and simulations.
<p></p>
5.7 &nbsp; There must be a clear assessment strategy for the MPharm degree. Assessment methods must measure the outcomes in Standard 10.
<p></p>
5.8 &nbsp; The MPharm degree assessment strategy should include:
<ul>
<li>diagnostic assessments;</li>
<li>formative assessments;</li>
<li>summative assessments;</li>
<li>timely feedback.</li>
</ul>
5.9 &nbsp; Academic regulations must be appropriate for a degree that is both academic and professional and which may lead to further professional training. As a general principle, all assessments must be passed. This means that condonation, compensation, trailing, extended re-sit opportunities and other remedial measures should be extremely limited, if they are permitted at all. MPharm degree academic regulations may be more stringent than university norms. This may include higher than usual pass marks for assessments demonstrating knowledge and skills essential to safe and effective pharmacy practice.
<p></p>
5.10 &nbsp; Marking criteria must be used for all assessments and all pass criteria must reflect safe and effective practice.
<p></p>
5.11 &nbsp; Patient safety must be paramount in assessments: any evidence of an assessment demonstrating unsafe practice must result in failure.
<p></p>
5.12 &nbsp; <i>A pre-registration training plan must describe how the learning outcomes for pre-registration will be delivered.</i>
<p></p>
5.13 &nbsp; <i>A pre-registration training plan must describe all assessments, including tutor evaluations and tutor sign-offs.</i>
<p></p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion" role="button">Evidence required for meeting this standard</button>
  <div class="gphcpanel">
  <p>5.14 &nbsp; Evidence sources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>MPharm degree teaching and learning strategies;</li>
<li>MPharm degree assessment strategies;</li>
<li>pharmacy research strategies;</li>
<li>assessment criteria;</li>
<li>academic regulations;</li>
<li>MPharm degree external examinersâ€™ reports;</li>
<li>reports of MPharm degree accreditation visits;</li>
<li>internal university quality reports;</li>
<li>evaluation and feedback from students, <i>trainees and tutors;</i></li>
<li>national peer-reviewed research assessment exercises;</li>
<li>Registration Examination progression data;</li>
<li><i>reports of pre-registration training site visits;</i></li>
<li><i>pre-registration training plans.</i></li>
</ul>
5.15 &nbsp; The required evidence includes:
<ul>
<li>evidence of the impact of teaching and learning strategies on course delivery and the student experience;</li>
<li>evidence of the impact of assessment strategies on course delivery and the student experience;</li>
<li>evidence of the impact of current research on course design;</li>
<li>evidence that assessment pass criteria reflect safe and effective practice;</li>
<li>evidence that issues raised during accreditation visits have been addressed;</li>
<li>evidence that evaluation and feedback from all sources has been acted on;</li>
<li>evidence that, where appropriate, reasonable adjustments have been made to course/<i>training</i> delivery for students/<i>trainees</i>;</li>
<li>evidence that attrition rates are understood;</li>
<li>evidence that Registration Assessment progression data has been used to inform course design;</li>
<li><i>evidence that pre-registration progression data has been used to inform course design.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the evidence listed above is likely to be included in evaluation processes already in place (and existing processes may well deal with more than one category of evidence).</p>
</div>
  <button class="accordion" role="button">Guidance on meeting this standard</button>
  <div class="gphcpanel">
  5.16 &nbsp; Assessment and feedback systems should be embedded in all five years of initial education and training.
<p></p>
5.17 &nbsp; There should be a range of teaching and learning methods to deliver the outcomes in Standard 10.
<p></p>
5.18 &nbsp; There should be a range of assessment methods to test all the outcomes in Standard 10.
<p></p>
5.19 &nbsp; Links between diagnostic, formative and summative assessments must be made clear to students <i>and trainees.</i>
<p></p>
5.20 &nbsp; Links between assessments and feedback must be made clear to students <i>and trainees</i>. Feedback must be given in time for it to be used effectively.
<p></p>
5.21 &nbsp; There should be deadlines for assessments to be marked and for feedback to be given. Action should be taken if deadlines are not met.
<p></p>
5.22 &nbsp; Where appropriate, reasonable adjustments must be made to curriculum delivery to help students <i>and trainees</i> with special and specific needs meet learning outcomes. Teaching, learning and assessment can be modified for this purpose but learning outcomes cannot.
